### What's wrong with other gems?

Just look at [Ruby-Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_comments). What we can see?

* [Acts as commentable with threading](https://github.com/elight/acts_as_commentable_with_threading) - so, guys, where is the render helper for the tree? There is no helper! Should  I make render helper for tree by myself? Nooooo!!! I'm so sorry, but I can't use this gem. 
* [acts_as_commentable](https://github.com/jackdempsey/acts_as_commentable) - so, I can see code for models. But I can't see code for controllers and views. Unfortunately, there is no threading. It's not enough for me.
* [opinio](https://github.com/Draiken/opinio) - looks better, but there is no threading. I want to have more!
* [has_threaded_comments](https://github.com/aarongough/has_threaded_comments) - Nice work! Nice gem! Models, controllers, views, view helper for tree rendering! **But**, last activity 2 years ago, I need few features, I think - I can make it better.
